# Meta-level configuration for Ready to Start
# THIS IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR LEVEL PROGRESSION
# Levels are generated algorithmically from these parameters

[Algorithm]
# Total number of levels to generate
total_levels = 20

# Maximum items allowed per menu page
max_settings_per_menu = 15

# Starting configuration
base_settings = 5
base_menus = 1

# Growth rates per level
settings_growth = 2
levels_per_new_menu = 3

# Randomness (0.0 = none, 1.0 = maximum variation)
variation = 0.2

# Formula description:
# menus(level) = base_menus + floor((level - 1) / levels_per_new_menu)
# total_settings(level) = base_settings + (level - 1) * settings_growth
# Then distribute total_settings across menus with variation
