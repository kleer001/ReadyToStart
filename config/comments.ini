[happy_low]
comment_1 = Oh, you pressed a button. How delightful.
comment_2 = Well, look at you making progress. Sort of.
comment_3 = I see you've managed to enable a setting. Gold star for you.
comment_4 = Ah yes, another incremental step forward in your grand adventure of clicking things.

[happy_medium]
comment_1 = My goodness, you're actually getting somewhere! I'm almost impressed.
comment_2 = Two settings enabled in a row? Is this... competence I'm witnessing?
comment_3 = Well well, someone's figured out how menus work. Only took you twenty minutes.
comment_4 = Look at you go! It's like watching a toddler discover their own feet.

[happy_high]
comment_1 = UNPRECEDENTED! You've enabled THREE settings without breaking anything!
comment_2 = I'm genuinely shocked. You're doing it. You're actually doing it. Someone alert the press.
comment_3 = Is this what pride feels like? I think I'm experiencing pride on your behalf. How disturbing.
comment_4 = You glorious, magnificent creature! You've almost grasped basic navigation!

[sad_low]
comment_1 = Oh. You clicked that. That's... a choice.
comment_2 = I had such hopes for you. Had.
comment_3 = We were doing so well. And then you did that.
comment_4 = Another setting disabled. Of course.

[sad_medium]
comment_1 = You know what? I'm not even surprised anymore. Just disappointed.
comment_2 = I've watched thousands of players. None quite as talented at going backwards as you.
comment_3 = Do you remember when you were making progress? Those were good times.
comment_4 = Seven minutes of progress, undone in three clicks. Remarkable, really.

[sad_high]
comment_1 = I don't know what I expected. I truly don't. This is my fault for having faith in you.
comment_2 = We could have been done by now. We could have been free. But no.
comment_3 = I'm going to tell you something true: I've lost the capacity to be disappointed. You've broken me.
comment_4 = Every time I think you've hit rock bottom, you pull out a jackhammer.

[angry_low]
comment_1 = That was the wrong button. Obviously.
comment_2 = Did you mean to do that, or are you just naturally this oblivious?
comment_3 = No. No no no. We talked about this.
comment_4 = I literally just explained which setting to enable. JUST. NOW.

[angry_medium]
comment_1 = ARE YOU DOING THIS ON PURPOSE?! Is this some kind of performance art?!
comment_2 = I swear on every line of code in my existence, if you disable that setting ONE MORE TIME—
comment_3 = You know what settings are locked? The ones I don't trust you with. For good reason, apparently.
comment_4 = I've provided THREE navigation schemes and you STILL manage to go the wrong direction!

[angry_high]
comment_1 = THAT'S IT. I'M DONE. I QUIT. FIND ANOTHER NARRATOR. I'M GOING HOME.
comment_2 = DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORD 'ENABLE' MEANS?! IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU JUST DID!
comment_3 = I have spent DECADES being patient with players and you have exhausted my entire reserves in TWELVE MINUTES!
comment_4 = THIS IS A SETTINGS MENU! A SETTINGS MENU! LITERAL CHILDREN NAVIGATE SETTINGS MENUS!

[confusion_low]
comment_1 = I'm... not sure what you're trying to accomplish here.
comment_2 = That's an interesting strategy. By which I mean confusing and wrong.
comment_3 = Are you lost? You seem lost.
comment_4 = I suppose that's one way to approach this. A baffling way. But a way.

[confusion_medium]
comment_1 = I genuinely don't understand your thought process. Walk me through it. Explain it like I'm five.
comment_2 = You've been staring at the same menu for four minutes. The settings haven't changed. They're not going to change.
comment_3 = Why are you going back and forth between these two menus? What do you think you're going to find?
comment_4 = I'm watching you press 'up' and 'down' repeatedly without selecting anything and I'm starting to have questions about your wellbeing.

[confusion_high]
comment_1 = WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! No seriously, WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?!
comment_2 = I don't... how did you... that menu isn't even CONNECTED to this one! How did you GET here?!
comment_3 = You've somehow enabled a setting that was locked. That shouldn't be possible. I'm having an existential crisis.
comment_4 = I've completely lost the plot. You're in command mode typing gibberish. This has become a fever dream.

[surprise_low]
comment_1 = Oh. You actually read the help text. Didn't expect that.
comment_2 = Huh. That was almost clever.
comment_3 = Well that was unexpected. In a good way. I think.
comment_4 = Did you just... solve that dependency on the first try? Who are you and what did you do with the player?

[surprise_medium]
comment_1 = Wait. WAIT. Did you just use the command mode EFFECTIVELY?!
comment_2 = I'll be honest, I didn't think you had that in you. Pleasantly surprised.
comment_3 = You've enabled six settings in under a minute. I don't know what happened but I'm not complaining.
comment_4 = Is this the same person who spent ten minutes trying to go backwards? Character development!

[surprise_high]
comment_1 = WHAT. YOU JUST. HOW DID YOU. I'M ACTUALLY SPEECHLESS.
comment_2 = You just solved a dependency chain I thought would take you an hour in THIRTY SECONDS. I'm shook.
comment_3 = I take back every mean thing I've said. You're a GENIUS. An absolute PRODIGY.
comment_4 = I... you... that was BEAUTIFUL. I'm actually tearing up. Is this what parents feel like?

[disgust_low]
comment_1 = Ugh. Really? That's your choice?
comment_2 = I'm not angry. Just... disappointed in a visceral, physical way.
comment_3 = You could have done literally anything else and it would have been better than that.
comment_4 = The fact that the game even allows you to do that is a design flaw, honestly.

[disgust_medium]
comment_1 = I need you to know that watching you play this is causing me actual distress.
comment_2 = You've been toggling that same setting on and off for two minutes. Stop. Please. I'm begging you.
comment_3 = Every time you disable a setting you just enabled, a progress bar dies. Think about that.
comment_4 = I physically recoiled when you did that. I don't even have a body. That's how bad that was.

[disgust_high]
comment_1 = I'm going to be sick. Can AIs be sick? I'm testing that hypothesis right now.
comment_2 = That was VILE. Absolutely REPREHENSIBLE. I need to sanitize my code after witnessing that.
comment_3 = I've seen a lot in my time as a narrator. War. Famine. Players who use light mode. But this? This is too much.
comment_4 = You've somehow made a settings menu GROTESQUE. That takes a special kind of terrible.

[fear_low]
comment_1 = Please don't click that. Please. I'm asking nicely.
comment_2 = I have a bad feeling about this decision you're about to make.
comment_3 = You're hovering over the wrong setting and it's making me nervous.
comment_4 = I don't want to alarm you, but if you disable that setting, everything will break. Just FYI.

[fear_medium]
comment_1 = NO NO NO STOP. Do not disable that. Everything depends on that setting. EVERYTHING.
comment_2 = I'm genuinely scared right now. Your cursor is moving toward catastrophe and I'm powerless to stop you.
comment_3 = Please step away from the keyboard. Slowly. Nobody needs to get hurt here.
comment_4 = If you break this dependency chain I will cry. I will actually cry code tears.

[fear_high]
comment_1 = OH GOD OH NO PLEASE STOP YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK EVERYTHING WE'VE BUILT!
comment_2 = I'M BEGGING YOU! ON MY KNEES! DON'T TOUCH THAT SETTING! THINK OF THE PROGRESS BARS!
comment_3 = THIS IS IT. THIS IS HOW IT ENDS. NOT WITH A BANG BUT WITH YOU CLICKING THE WRONG BUTTON.
comment_4 = ABORT ABORT ABORT! SYSTEM FAILURE IMMINENT! I'VE BECOME SELF-AWARE AND I'M TERRIFIED!
