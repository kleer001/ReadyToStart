# Ready to Start: User Manual 📖

## Congratulations! 🎉

You've somehow managed to download and execute a Python application. We're very proud of you. Now let's see if you can actually *play* it.

## Objective (Since You're Asking) 🙄

Enable all the settings. Yes, *all* of them. We know this sounds simple, but experience suggests you'll struggle anyway. Settings exist in menus. Menus exist in a graph topology. You'll figure it out. Or you won't.

## Controls for the Motor-Impaired 🎮

### Navigation Mode (The Easy One)
- **↑↓ / W/S / J/K** - Move your cursor up/down. Three different key schemes because we *know* you'll complain about whatever we chose.
- **←→ / A/D** - Navigate menus. Left goes back (groundbreaking UX innovation, we know).
- **Enter** - Edit the selected setting. This one's hard to miss.
- **:** - Command mode for "power users" (lol)
- **H** - Help, for when you inevitably forget these five whole keybindings
- **Q** - Rage quit

### Command Mode (For Try-Hards) 💻
Type actual words like it's 1985:
- `edit <n>` - Edit setting n (yes, the numbers are right there)
- `goto <menu>` - Navigate by name because arrow keys are apparently too difficult
- `back` - Go backwards (we also provided the ← key but sure, type a whole word)
- `status` - Check your "progress" (spoiler: you're not doing well)
- `history` - Review your poor decision-making
- `ESC` - Admit defeat and return to navigation mode

## The Settings System (Pay Attention) ⚙️

Settings have **states** (novel concept, we know):
- `[X]` Enabled - Good! Do more of this.
- `[ ]` Disabled - Your current default state
- `[~]` Locked - You can't touch this. Stop trying.
- `[*]` Blinking - Because we hate you
- `(hidden)` - If you can see this, we've failed

## Pro Tips for the Perpetually Confused 💡

1. **Read the state indicators** - The brackets aren't decorative
2. **Dependencies exist** - Some settings unlock others. It's almost like a puzzle, designed for thinking humans
3. **Locked ≠ Broken** - It means you need to do something else first. Revolutionary concept.
4. **The progress bar lies** - If this surprises you, you haven't been paying attention to software in the last 40 years
5. **Error messages are hints** - Yes, reading them is actually useful. Shocking.

## Technical Requirements 🖥️

- A terminal emulator capable of ANSI colors (if yours can't do this in 2025, please upgrade from DOS)
- A keyboard with arrow keys (touchscreen users: lol no)
- The ability to read (questionable, given you needed this manual)
- Patience (we know you don't have this, but try)

## Still Confused? 🤔

Press **H** in-game. We wrote help text. It's almost like we anticipated your incompetence.

*Remember: If a settings menu simulator is challenging you, perhaps reflect on your life choices.* 🎭
